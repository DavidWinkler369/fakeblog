                    Before COVID-19, I was a international techno DJ. 
                    Here is a picture of me DJing a Halloween party in LA 2019.
                    I miss performing a lot but I also don't because it was a very draining lifestyle and I made very little money LOL.
                    When things re-open I plan to DJ again but as a side hustle while I maintain my full time coding career. 
                    This way I can do the things I love whilst maintaining a balanced lifestyle!

                    I rarely get to do this because I am so busy! 
                    But when I do play I like to play RPG's :3</h2>

                    I made him with the assistance of an AI StyleGan
                    I hope to combine my coding skills with my newfound AI art to change the world >:)</h2>
